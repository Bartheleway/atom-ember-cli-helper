The Ember CLI Helper is super easy to use.  Just press `clt-alt-o` or search
for `ember cli helper` in the command palette.

## Todo List

- [ ] Open `ember-cli-helper` automatically if the package uses the Ember CLI
- [ ] Differentiate a task's button from the others when it is active
- [ ] Use the editor's theme to get colors for success and error in the command output

together.
